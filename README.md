# vitis-projects
some basic vitis projects to play-around and learn

Some of the examples are taken from https://github.com/spcl/hls_tutorial_examples/tree/master/example_1/xilinx but code is changed to support Vitis 2021.2.

Each folder has a kernel, host code, and a readme that contains information about learning takeaways
